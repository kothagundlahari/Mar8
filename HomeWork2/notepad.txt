1.write a program in javascript to print the least value of variables a and b ? (flow chart and program)?
2.Differences between == and ===?
sol: 

    JavaScript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison. For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type and:

        Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
        Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
        Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
        Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
        Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined) is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]

     0 == false   // true
     0 === false  // false, because they are of a different type
     1 == "1"     // true, automatic type conversion for value only
     1 === "1"    // false, because they are of a different type
     null == undefined // true
    null === undefined // false
     '0' == false // true
   '0' === false // false

3. logical and && 
The AND operator (&&) returns true if both expressions are true, otherwise it returns false.



4.logical or || 
The OR operator (||) returns true if one or both expressions are true, otherwise it returns false.
5.logical not !
The NOT operator (!) returns true for false statements and false for true statements.
