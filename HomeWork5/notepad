1) print whole number from 0 to 10 using a while loop and increment operator. (flowchart and program)
2) research and convert this from while loop to do while loop?
3) research and convert this from while loop to for loop?
4) experiement with break?
5) can we have if condition in a while loop?
6) what are infinite loops? how can we avoid them in programs?
An infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions in a computer program which loops endlessly, either due to the loop
having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over.

Avoiding infinite loops:
You don't need to write done = False; while not done:. Just loop infinitely (while True) and then use break to exit the loop when you're finished.

input executes the code that the user types (think of it like what the Python shell does). You want raw_input, which returns a string so you need to pass it to int:

numA = int(raw_input("..."))

abs(numB) will compute the absolute value of numB, but won't do anything with it. You need to store the result of that function call in numB, which you do like numB = abs(numB).

The idiom x and True or False is not used in recent Python versions; instead, use True if x else false. However, returning True if x == True else False is the same as just returning x, so do that.

You don't need to loop while x == True. Just loop while x.
